  <h1>About</h1>

  <h5>
    I started working in visual effects in 2008 and have worked on numerous film and commercial projects since then. Some of the top-listed films I've contributed towards are The Avengers, Captain America, Thor2, and Oz the Great and Powerful. I am most often hired as a compositor, but I also have experience as a matte painter and Nuke tool developer.  These other experiences developed my technical and artistic abilities so that I am able to handle some of the more difficult tasks on a show!  
  </br>
  </br>
    My BFA comes from The Rhode Island School of Design where I graduated with honors in 2005.  Afterwards I studied visual effects at The Academy of Art University in San Francisco through their master's program.
